Research shows that girls’ interest in STEM decreases yearly since they’re around 12 years of age. I want to change this. After participating in the events and non-profit organisations to encourage Girls in STEM, I decided to use intenet to make an impact on young people, encourage them and share my learnings and career path. 

Through EISTEECH and GDSC organizations, I have organized five workshops, reaching over 50 participants. I focused on teaching school-going girls the fundamentals of coding and computer hardware in their native language. By introducing technical education early, I aimed to break the psychological barrier that hindered their interest in STEM subjects. Additionally, I held workshops where I taught girls Unsupervised Machine Learning (Clustering and K means) and AI Algorithms (Mini-Max) which had almost 100% registration and attendance.

But it's not all algorithms and code. I'm all about balance, sharing tips on study habits, science communication, and how to juggle life's many demands—especially as a woman in STEM. Plus, a little beauty and femininity talk never hurt!

I found myself enjoying in the role of mentor as well as helping to strengthen leadership skills along networking with peers. Through lectures, workshops, and social media collabs, I desire to inspire people to explore tech and science! 


Career advices and lessons that I learned (harder way?)

Currently, I am doing the internship at J.P.Morgan Chase as Software Engineer, working with (and learning from) people who are probably much smarter than me. I previously interned at some companies including Microsoft, Google, J.P.Morgan etc, so I have had a sizeable amount of time working on teams that focus on scientific computing and performance. I worked a year at Airbnb on the machine learning infrastructure team and I learned lots from my peers. Additionaly, I managed to achive some scholarships and awards such as GHC scholarship for Women in tech and awards at multiple hackathons.

Additionaly I was accepted at Summer Schools Programs such as OxML and Lady Margaret's Summer Schoool on Advanced NLP. 

I know that many people struggle getting their first internship so did I, and I am here to make that part easeir. During past few years I've been collecting resources of possibl opportunities for students in EMEA, including SWE inerships, research internships, Summer schools and schoolarships. Take a look at my Opportunities page!

University Of Belgrade - notes, tutorials and many more

In my free time I am also contibutin to the development of siwiki website which is wikpedia for all courses and opportunities for Students at Univeristy of Belgrade.
