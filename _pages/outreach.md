Research shows that girls' interest in STEM decreases yearly once they reach the age of 12. I am determined to change this. After participating in events and non-profit organizations aimed at encouraging girls in STEM, I decided to use the internet to make an impact on young people by encouraging them and sharing my learnings and career path.

Through the EISTEECH and GDSC organizations, I have organized five workshops, reaching over 50 participants. I focused on teaching school-going girls the fundamentals of coding and computer hardware in their native language. By introducing technical education early, I aimed to break the psychological barriers that hindered their interest in STEM subjects. Additionally, I held workshops where I taught girls about Unsupervised Machine Learning (Clustering and K means) and AI Algorithms (Mini-Max), which had almost 100% registration and attendance.

But it's not all about algorithms and code. I'm all about balance, sharing tips on study habits, science communication, and how to juggle life's many demands—especially as a woman in STEM. Plus, a little beauty and femininity talk never hurt!

For me, changing perceptions of the male-dominated industry starts with visibility—having role models who show young women what's possible.
We need to ensure there are no misconceptions or stereotypes that make girls think they can't be (at least!) as good as men in these fields. By challenging these outdated ideas and highlighting the achievements of women, we can inspire confidence in the next generation. I've found fulfillment in mentoring, enhancing leadership skills, and networking, aspiring to be a role model for young women and empower them to flourish. Through lectures, workshops, and social media collaborations, my goal is to inspire others to explore tech!

University Of Belgrade - Course Notes

In my free time, I also contribute to the development of the SIwiki website, a Wikipedia for all faculty courses with a collection of materials such as lectures, exercises, exam solutions, and more. Project was introduced to make learning and collaboration easier. All project pages are publicly visible, and anyone from the ETF can contribute.

Currently, we have 156 users and maintain 405 pages of exams, 73 pages of lab exercises, and 57 pages of course materials. Down belowe you can find my personal notes for some courses:
