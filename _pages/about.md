Hey! I'm a third year undergraduate student at Belgrade University studying software engineering. During past years I was honored with multiple awards and scholarships, including the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, which is the world's largest gathering of women technologists.
I've had the privilege of interning at like Google, Microsoft and J.P.Morgan. See my CV. In particular, I find these areas interesting to work with in the future:

In my free time I decided to use internt to impact society especially Women and share the knowledge that I gained. Please see my Outreach page for more. I do inspirational lectures, workshops and academic talks. One example is titled “Studing physics when you feel stupid”. See my Outreach page for more.  

Research shows that girls’ interest in STEM decreases yearly since they’re around 12 years of age. I want to change this. After founding the non-profit organisation Girls in STEM and working with this problem for over six years, I decided to use social media to make an impact on young people.

With over 150,000 followers, I work on this every day. My outreach brand covers everything from studying tips, and science communication to work-life balance and femininity/beauty as a woman in STEM. 

Through inspirational lectures, workshops, and collaborations on social media, I aim to inspire more girls to do technology and science. In Sweden, I am represented by the agency Infly.
