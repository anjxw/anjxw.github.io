 Hey! I'm a third year undergraduate student at Belgrade University. I believe that you don’t really know what you’re talking about unless you can present the information in a digestible and intuitive way. In order to ensure I really know the material I learned, I compile them in blogposts here. Some of these blogposts somehow got traction on reddit and hackernews, and has been translated in multiple languages. I’m thankful for the appreciative emails, and I’ve recently just added a comment functionality to my blog!

 During past years I was honored with multiple awards and scholarships, including the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, which is the world's largest gathering of women technologists.
I've had the privilege of interning at like Google, Microsoft and J.P.Morgan. See my CV. In particular, I find these areas interesting to work with in the future:

In my free time I decided to use internt to impact society especially Women and share the knowledge that I gained. Please see my Outreach page for more. I do inspirational lectures, workshops and academic talks. One example is titled “Studing physics when you feel stupid”. See my Outreach page for more.  

Research shows that girls’ interest in STEM decreases yearly since they’re around 12 years of age. I want to change this. After founding the non-profit organisation Girls in STEM and working with this problem for over six years, I decided to use social media to make an impact on young people.

With over 150,000 followers, I work on this every day. My outreach brand covers everything from studying tips, and science communication to work-life balance and femininity/beauty as a woman in STEM. 

Through inspirational lectures, workshops, and collaborations on social media, I aim to inspire more girls to do technology and science. In Sweden, I am represented by the agency Infly.
I recently started a job at Hudson River Trading (HRT) in New York as an Algorithm Engineer, working with (and learning from) people who are probably much smarter than me. I previously interned at some companies including Airbnb, Citadel Securities, Bloomberg etc, so I have had a sizeable amount of time working on teams that focus on scientific computing and performance. I worked a year at Airbnb on the machine learning infrastructure team and I learned lots from my peers.

If you have questions about what I wrote in my blog, don’t hesitate to shoot me a message at rayzhang@g.ucla.edu or just leave a comment on the blog. I’m just a human, so I make typos!
