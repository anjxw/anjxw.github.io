 Hey! I'm a third year undergraduate student at Belgrade University. I believe that you don’t really know what you’re talking about unless you can present the information in a digestible and intuitive way. In order to ensure I really know the material I learned, I compile them in blogposts here. Some of these blogposts somehow got traction on reddit and hackernews, and has been translated in multiple languages. I’m thankful for the appreciative emails, and I’ve recently just added a comment functionality to my blog!

 During past years I was honored with multiple awards and scholarships, including the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, which is the world's largest gathering of women technologists.
I've had the privilege of interning at like Google, Microsoft and J.P.Morgan. See my CV. In particular, I find these areas interesting to work with in the future:

In my free time I decided to use internt to impact society especially Women and share the knowledge that I gained. Please see my Outreach page for more. I do inspirational lectures, workshops and academic talks. One example is titled “Studing physics when you feel stupid”. See my Outreach page for more.
