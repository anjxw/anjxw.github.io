Hey, I am happy to e-meet you! I'm a third-year undergraduate student at the University of Belgrade, passionate about programming. While I enjoy learning and developing technical skills, I'm most excited about building projects! You can find my <b><a href="">Projects</a></b> here.

Previously, I interned at <b>Google</b> and <b>Microsoft </b> and I have received multiple awards and scholarships such as the <b><a href="">GHC Scholarship</a> </b>for Women in Computing. Additionally, I managed to secure a place at <b><a href="https://www.oxfordml.school/">OxML 2023</a> </b> and <b><a href="https://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/advanced-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-natural-language-processing">Oxford Advanced AI and ML: Natural Language Processing</a></b>. See my <b><a href="">CV</a></b> for more details and <b><a href="">Opportunities</a></b> page if you're looking for help finding the internship or advice. You can also reach out to me direclty!

As someone passionate about tech, I strive to <b>impact society</B> and <b>inspire others to explore tech </b>, especially women in STEM, through various <b>talks</b>, <b>mentoring events</b>, and <b>workshops</b> that I hold! One example is titled "Studying Physics When You Feel Stupid." Please see my <b><a href="">Outrage</a> </b> page for more!

I believe that having knowledge is not valuable unless you know how to share it with others! Over the past few years, I have been writing <b><a href="">blogs</a> </b>, mainly about <b>general CS </b> and <b>C++</b>. This has taught me how to present information in a digestible and intuitive way and share knowledge with others while ensuring that I truly understod the material I've learned. Some of these blog posts have gained traction on Reddit and were published in editions on Medium.

My hobbies include playing board games, riding my bike, running, bouldering, traveling... I enjoy these even more in the wonderful company!  Take a look at my  gallerie. Iâ€™m always open to collaborating with others, so feel free to get in touch! :)
