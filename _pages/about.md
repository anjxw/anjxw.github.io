Hey, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹ <br>
I'm a undergraduate student at the University of Belgrade. As aspiring Softwae Engineer, Iâ€™m broadly interested in all aspects of , and particularly in . <b><a href="">projects</a></b>!

Previously, I interned at <b><a href="https://about.google/">Google</a></b> and <b><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/about">Microsoft</a></b> and I have received multiple awards and scholarships such as the <b><a href="">GHC Scholarship</a> </b> to attend GHC, the worldâ€™s largest gathering of women in tech. Additionally, I was selected for <b><a href="https://www.oxfordml.school/">OxML 2023</a> </b> and <b><a href="https://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/advanced-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-natural-language-processing">Oxford Advanced AI and ML: Natural Language Processing</a></b> summer schools where I learned about advanced ML topics and  met speakers from <b> MIT Media Lab</b>, <b>Google</b>, <b>Watson AI</b> and more. See my <b><a href="">CV</a></b> and <b><a href="">opportunities</a></b> page if you're looking for help finding the internship or advice. You can also reach out to me direclty! 

As someone passionate about tech, I strive to <b>impact society</B> and <b>inspire others to explore tech </b>, especially <b><a href="">women in STEM</a></b>, through various <b>talks</b>, <b>mentoring events</b>, and <b>workshops</b> that I hold! Together with a group of students I <b><a href="">organized first ML hackathon</a></b>, The Great Hacka, where I <b>mentored teams</b> throughout the hackathon and <b>assisted them in overcoming challenges</b> and <b>refining their projects.</b> Also recently, during my internship with Microsoft, I participated at <b><a href="">Women Know IT</a></b> event where I <b>gave a talk about learning coding, leadership nad imposter sindrome</b>. I also gave overview of my internship experience and project demo to the <b><a href="">100+ perspective young women</a></b>. Please see my <b><a href="">outrage</a> </b> and  <b><a href="">CV</a></b> page for more!

I believe that having knowledge is not valuable unless you know how to share it with others! Over the past few years, I have been writing <b><a href="">blogs</a> </b>, mainly about <b><a href="">general CS</a> </b> and <b><a href="">C++</a></b>. This has taught me how to present information in a digestible and intuitive way and share knowledge with others while ensuring that I truly understod the material I've learned. Some of these blog posts have gained traction on Reddit and were published in editions on Medium.

My hobbies include playing board games, riding my bike, running, bouldering, traveling... I enjoy these even more in the wonderful company!  Take a look at my  gallerie. Iâ€™m always open to collaborating with others, so feel free to get in touch! :)
